# FriendFinder

Friend Finder is an application that pairs you with a new friend. It pairs you with your best matched friend based off of the user's survey results. 

How It Works:
This is a full-stack application that receives input from the user. That input is then pushed to the back-end using nodeJS and express routers.
From there the input is pushed to our API which is then used to compare the new user input with existing information to find the user's best 
matched friend. When we get the result from the comparison the back-end stores that information to make it avaliable for the front-end to grab and post
to the user. The result is populated to the user by a bootstrap modal. The modal populates once the user submits their survey responses.

Technologies Used:
-JavaScript
-jQuery
-nodeJS
-express.js
